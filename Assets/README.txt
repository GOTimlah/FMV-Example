FMV Example - A basic walkthrough on how to create a really basic FMV game.

If this were a real game, I'd use this file to include all of the licenses I have to abide by. 
I was using Pexels for the free videos I found for this game, so I would:

1) Find the video I want
2) If in Pexels, go to it (For instance: https://www.pexels.com/video/walking-in-the-middle-of-the-forest-3744556/)
3) I would click the Info button under the video itself
4) Then check for any attribution requirements.

The video example above had no attribution required, so I don't need to say anything... But I got the video from the above link anyway :)
